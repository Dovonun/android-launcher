# Product Guidelines

## Visual Aesthetic: Material Design 3 (Material You)
- **Dynamic Color:** Support system-wide dynamic colors for a cohesive user experience.
- **Native Components:** Utilize standard Material 3 components to ensure a familiar and accessible feel.
- **Consistency:** Align with modern Android design patterns for spacing, typography, and iconography.

## Voice and Tone: Invisible
- **Minimal Text:** Rely on intuitive icons and clear gestures rather than textual instructions.
- **Subtlety:** Labels and text should only appear when absolutely necessary for clarity.
- **Focus:** The interface should stay out of the way, letting the user's apps be the primary focus.

## UX Philosophy: Gesture-First
- **Implicit Interaction:** Prioritize swipes, long-presses, and direct manipulation over menus and visible buttons.
- **Fast Navigation:** Ensure gestures are responsive and lead to immediate, predictable actions.
- **Flow:** Maintain a smooth, uninterrupted user flow by minimizing modal dialogs and interruptions.

## Development Principles: Pragmatic MVVM
- **Simplicity over Abstraction:** Avoid over-engineering. Use standard ViewModels and StateFlow, but keep the architecture lean.
- **Best Code is No Code:** Favor built-in Android/Compose solutions over custom implementations or third-party libraries.
- **Readability:** Write clear, idiomatic Kotlin code that is easy for a new user to understand and maintain.
