# Specification: Refine system navigation and UX

## Goal
Improve the launcher's handling of system-level navigation to ensure it feels native and responsive.

## Requirements
- **Home Button Behavior:** Ensure that pressing the Home button (or gesture) reliably returns the user to the Favorites view from any state (All-Apps view, search, etc.).
- **Back Gesture Handling:** Implement correct back navigation logic. For example, the back gesture from All-Apps should return to Favorites.
- **App Dismissal:** Ensure that dismissing an app (e.g., via the recent apps switcher) or returning from an app provides a smooth transition back to the launcher.
- **Edge-to-Edge Support:** Verify and polish the UI behavior around system bars and cutouts during navigation.
