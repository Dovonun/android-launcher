# Implementation Plan: Refine system navigation and UX

## Phase 1: Analysis & Infrastructure
- [x] Task: Audit current navigation behavior and identify specific "rough edges" in system gestures.
- [x] Task: Verify current `MainActivity` launch mode and intent filters for correct home screen behavior.
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: Analysis & Infrastructure' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 2: Refine Home & Back Behavior
- [ ] Task: Implement/Refine back gesture handling in Compose to navigate between launcher views (e.g., All-Apps to Favorites).
- [ ] Task: Ensure Home intent always resets the launcher state to the primary Favorites view.
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 2: Refine Home & Back Behavior' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 3: UX Polish
- [ ] Task: Add or refine transitions/animations between views for a smoother experience.
- [ ] Task: Verify behavior when returning from external activities (app launches).
